					<div class="card-body">
						<p>Given the current global situation the demand for online assessment tool that satisfy educator needs has increased drastically. Developerers do not always have full understandng of their target users resulted from a lack of interest or just tight deadlines imposed. For the creation of this tool we have taken the time to survey both educators and students about their experience with online assessment methods. This results helped us develop a tool with assessment features comparable to consacrated systems like Moodle or Blackboard but as an less overwhelming package.</p>
